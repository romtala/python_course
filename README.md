# Python Basic Programs

This repository contains two simple Python programs:

## ðŸ§® Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
- Displays the result.


# ðŸ§® Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This Python program calculates the **sum of all integers from 1 to 50** using a `for` loop. It is a simple example demonstrating the use of loops and arithmetic operations in Python.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. Initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0.
2. Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50 (inclusive).
3. In each iteration, the current number is added to `total_sum`.
4. After the loop, the final sum is printed.
