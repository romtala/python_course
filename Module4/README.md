# Python Math Programs

This repository contains two Python programs focused on mathematical calculations using functions and the math module.

## ðŸ§® Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Description
This program defines a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial is calculated using either a loop or recursion.

### Features
- Handles positive integers (and zero).
- Returns an error message for negative numbers.
- Demonstrates both iterative and recursive approaches (you can choose which to use).

# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

## Description

This Python program asks the user to input a number and then calculates the following using the built-in `math` module:

- Square root of the number
- Natural logarithm (log base *e*) of the number
- Sine of the number (in radians)

The program also handles invalid inputs and domain errors (e.g., logarithm of zero or negative numbers).

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a number.
2. The program checks if the number is positive before calculating the square root and natural logarithm.
3. The sine of the number is calculated regardless of its value.
4. Results are displayed clearly.
