# File Handling Tasks in Python

This repository contains two Python programs demonstrating basic file operations including reading, writing, appending, and error handling.

---

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
2. Prints its content line by line.
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

### Expected Behavior:

- **If the file exists:** The program prints the contents line by line.
- **If the file does not exist:** The program prints an error message indicating the file is missing.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`.
2. Appends additional data to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.

### Expected Behavior:

- The program writes the user input to `output.txt`.
- Then appends predefined text to the file.
- Finally, reads and prints the complete contents of `output.txt`.

## How to Run

1. Save the scripts as `read_file.py` (Task 1) and `write_append_file.py` (Task 2).
2. Run the programs using Python 3:

```bash
python Task1.py
python Task2.py
